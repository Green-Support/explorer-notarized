# README

With this Patch, you can show the latest Notarization data on a Insight Explorer.

Works with Decker's repo: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install/ (Install all Komodo ecosystem daemons and explorers)

or my repo: https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer (Useful to install just an explorer for a Komodo ecosystem daemon and blockchain you already have)

You can use the patch like so:

```bash
#"cd" into the directory where the explorer is installed. i.e., the directories "ASSETCHAINNAME-explorer" and this repo should on the same level
git clone https://github.com/gcharang/explorer-notarized
cd explorer-notarized
./patch.sh ASSETCHAINNAME
```
